  i3c-od-scl-hz:
    type: int
    description: |
      Open Drain Frequency for the I3C controller. When undefined, use
      the controller default or as specified by the I3C specification.

  clk-divider:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Main clock divider for I3C. If not specified, the default value
      will be used if changing clock divider is supported by the SoC.

  clk-divider-tc:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Slow time control clock divider for I3C. If not specified, the
      default value will be used if changing clock divider is supported
      by the SoC.

  clk-divider-slow:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Slow clock divider for I3C. If not specified, the default value
      will be used if changing clock divider is supported by the SoC.

  disable-open-drain-high-pp:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If false, open drain high time is 1 PPBAUD count,
      which is short high and long low.
      If true, open drain high time is same as ODBAUD
      so that open drain clock is 50% duty cycle.
      Default is false.
